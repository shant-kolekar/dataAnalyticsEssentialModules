# Data Analytics Essential Modules
This repository provides a foundational overview of key modules for data analytics in Python. These modules are essential for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and are highly recommended for anyone looking to build a solid base in data analytics.

## Key Modules
If you're just starting out and need to prioritize your learning, focus on the following modules in this order:

**Pandas**: for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures(data frames & data series) and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly.

**NumPy**: Fundamental for numerical operations and handling arrays. It supports a wide range of mathematical functions and operations.

**Matplotlib**: The core plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

**Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

**SciPy**: Adds additional functionality for scientific and technical computing, including modules for optimization, integration, and interpolation.

**Math**: Provides mathematical functions that are not covered by the built-in Python.

**Datetime**: Essential for handling and manipulating date and time data.
